Hi there!
I am Hossein, an embedded systems engineer who loves turning ideas into working, reliable systems. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers like AVR, STM32, STM8, and ESP32.

I design PCBs using Altium Designer and KiCad, and I have a strong interest in Linux, not just as a development environment, but also as a key part of embedded systems.

I enjoy digging into low-level code, working with real-time systems, and bringing devices to life through communication protocols like UART, SPI, I2C, and USB. I’m also fascinated by networking and enjoy working on projects that involve communication between devices or systems.

I have a strong passion for continuous learning and always seek to expand my knowledge, whether it’s exploring new technologies, diving deeper into embedded Linux, or experimenting with networking stacks and protocols.

I’m always looking to build solutions that are efficient, maintainable, and built to last.
